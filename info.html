    <h1>What is HPASS?</h1>
    HPASS(&trade;) is a lightweight, intuitive, simple and easy to use tool to
    create strong passwords.

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    If you think there is room for improvement in your current approach to
    password handling you may find HPASS helpful. One way to store and share
    passwords is by using a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a
    >. It is an often recommended and widely used solution, but not without
    problems.
    <p>
      HPASS(&trade;) uses an alternative approach with one major advantage:
      passwords are generated locally, on-demand and never stored in any central
      location. Passwords and few parameters to generate them (
      <tt><strong>Hint</strong></tt
      >, <tt><strong>Secret</strong></tt
      >, <tt><strong>Special Character</strong></tt
      >, and <tt><strong>Length</strong></tt
      >) are never stored in any centralized location, only on your local
      device, so there is no danger of data breach so often reported for
      password managers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large number of sites and apps offer strong random password generation,
      but quite extensive search (see links below) failed to find any which
      would allow to generate reproducible, hint-derived passwords as HPASS
      does.
    </p>
    <h2>Typical usage</h2>
    <p>
      Assume you need a password for a website:
      URL=<tt>https://www.abc.com</tt>. You can simply enter <tt>abc</tt> as a
      password hint into <tt>"Enter Hint"</tt> input box and press generate
      button (<img width="32rem" height="16rem" src="icons/generate.svg" />).
      This will generate password string and copy it to the clipboard, and you
      can paste it where it is needed. As a convenience feature, if you enter
      the whole URL the app will automatically extract secondary domain (i.e.
      "abc" in this example) as a password <tt><strong>Hinr</strong></tt
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The default settings (<tt><strong>Special Character</strong></tt> = "_",
        <tt><strong>Length</strong></tt> = 15) have been selected to satisfy
        most password requirements. Some websites will not accept certain
        special characters, and some impose rather short maximum password length
        - "_" and 15 seems to be accepted by most (if not all) sites.
      </li>

      <li>
        Purpose of <tt><strong>Secret</strong></tt> is to create different
        passwords for users using the same other parameters.
      </li>

      <li>
        HPASS generates password from given input parameters through
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/one_way_hash_algorithm"
          >one-way hash function</a
        >
        and the input parameters cannot be recovered from the password string.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security considerations</h2>
    Keeping only local copies of any sensitive information is more secure and
    less tempting for any hackers then keeping it in a centralized location -
    just compare relative effort and potential payoff of braking once into
    central database with millions of password vs braking into millions of
    individual devices. However,
    <a
      href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/you-cant-secure-100-of-your-data-100-of-the-time"
      >no information is 100% secure if it is written down</a
    >, and
    <a
      href="https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/letters/theres-no-such-thing-as-100-secure-data/"
    >
      the only secure data is the one that is kept in your head</a
    >
    (barring any mind-reading capabilities :). Given that, if you are still
    concerned about the possibility of some bad actors braking into your device
    and stealing settings you use to generate password, there are some steps you
    can take to make your passwords virtually 100% secure by paying (small)
    inconvenience price. For example you can:
    <ol>
      <li>
        "decorate" hint with some extra characters e.g. instead of using
        <tt>abc</tt> you can always append some character(s) (known only to
        you!) to it
      </li>
      <li>use generated password as a hint and generate password again</li>
    </ol>
    You can invent more simple schemes to accomplish the same goal i.e. that the
    part of the whole password generating procedure is stored only in your head
    :) Of course, if the sites you need to login into where the security is most
    important (bank accounts, etc) offer multifactor authentication (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"
      >MFA</a
    >) it is always a good idea to use it.

    <h2>Problems with password managers</h2>
    <p>
      You can find multiple sources discussing pros and cons of using password
      manager. Very short list is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> convenience, ability to share passwords</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cons:</strong> need to remember master password, vulnerability
        to hacking, safety
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can argue that HPASS has all advantages and none of dissadventages of
      password managers.
