    <h1>What is HPASS?</h1>
    HPASS(&trade;) is a lightweight, intuitive, simple and easy-to-use tool to
    create strong passwords.

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    If you think there is room for improvement in your current approach to
    password handling you may find HPASS helpful. One way to store and share
    passwords is by using a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a
    >. It is an often recommended and widely used solution, but not without
    problems.
    <p>
      HPASS(&trade;) uses an alternative approach with one major advantage:
      passwords are generated locally, on-demand and never stored in any central
      location. Passwords and few parameters to generate them (
      <tt><strong>Hint</strong></tt
      >, <tt><strong>Secret</strong></tt
      >, <tt><strong>Special Character</strong></tt
      >, and <tt><strong>Length</strong></tt
      >) are never stored in any centralized location, only on your local
      device, so there is no danger of data breach so often reported for
      password managers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large number of sites and apps offer strong random password generation,
      but quite extensive search (see links below) failed to find any which
      would allow to generate reproducible, hint-derived passwords as HPASS
      does.
    </p>
    <p>
      UPDATE [2024-03-01]: Apparently
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Password_(algorithm)"
        >Master Password</a
      >
      (rebranded now as Spectre
      <a href="https://spectre.app">https://spectre.app</a>) was developed in
      2012. It uses basically the same idea as HPASS -
      <strong
        >do not store password, generate reproducible password when you need
        it</strong
      >. You can find there extensive explanations why this is a better solution
      then storing passwords, as password managers do. However, the whole
      process Spectre uses seems overcomplicated and restrictive at the same
      time. For example, in addition to the HPASS
      <tt><strong>Secret</strong></tt> eqivalent,it requires user name, it
      generates passwords only following few fixed templates, etc. Take a look,
      and decide for yourself.
    </p>
    <h2>Typical usage</h2>
    <p>
      Assume you need a password for a website:
      URL=<tt>https://www.abc.com</tt>. You can simply enter <tt>abc</tt> as a
      password hint into <tt>"Enter Hint"</tt> input box and press generate
      button (<img
        src="icons/generate.svg"
        style="width: 2rem; height: 0.8rem"
      />). This will generate password string and copy it to the clipboard, and
      you can paste it where it is needed. As a convenience feature, if you
      enter the whole URL the app will automatically extract secondary domain
      (i.e. "abc" in this example) as a password <tt><strong>Hint</strong></tt
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The default settings (<tt><strong>Special Character</strong></tt> = "_",
        <tt><strong>Length</strong></tt> = 15) have been selected to satisfy
        most password requirements. Some websites will not accept certain
        special characters, and some impose rather short maximum password length
        - "_" and 15 seems to be accepted by most (if not all) sites.
      </li>

      <li>
        Purpose of <tt><strong>Secret</strong></tt> is to create different
        passwords for users using the same other parameters.
      </li>

      <li>
        HPASS generates password from given input parameters through
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/one_way_hash_algorithm"
          >one-way hash function</a
        >
        and the input parameters cannot be recovered from the password string.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security considerations</h2>
    Keeping only local copy of any sensitive information is more secure and
    less tempting for any potential hackers then keeping it in a centralized location -
    just compare relative effort and payoff of breaking once into
    central database with millions of password vs breaking into millions of
    individual devices.
    However,
    <a
      href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/you-cant-secure-100-of-your-data-100-of-the-time"
      >no information is 100% secure if it is written down</a
    >, and
    <a
      href="https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/letters/theres-no-such-thing-as-100-secure-data/"
    >
      the only secure data is the one that is kept in your head</a
    >
    (barring any mind-reading capabilities :). Given that, if you are still
    concerned about some bad actors breaking into your device
    and stealing settings you use to generate password, there are some steps you
    can take to make your passwords virtually 100% secure by paying (small)
    inconvenience price. For example you can:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use <strong>To Secret</strong> and <strong>Burn</strong> for extra layer
        of security.
        These two parameters are never stored.
      </li>
      <li>
        "decorate" hint with some extra characters e.g. instead of using
        <tt>abc</tt> you can always append some character(s) (known only to
        you!) to it
      </li>
      <li>use generated password as a hint and generate password again</li>
    </ol>
    You can probably invent more simple schemes to accomplish the same goal i.e.
    that the part of the whole password generating procedure is stored only in
    your head :) Of course, if the sites you need to login into where the
    security is most important (bank accounts, etc.) offer multifactor
    authentication (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"
      >MFA</a
    >) it is always a good idea to use it.

    <h2>Problems with password managers</h2>
    <p>
      You can find multiple sources discussing pros and cons of using password
      manager. Very short list is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> convenience, ability to share passwords</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cons:</strong> need to remember master password, vulnerability
        to hacking, safety, lock-in for browser build-in password managers.
      </li>
    </ul>
