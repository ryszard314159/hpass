    <h1>What is HPASS?</h1>
    HPASS(&trade;, &copy;) is a lightweight, intuitive, simple and easy-to-use tool to
    create and use strong and unique passwords.
    It is implemented as Progressive Web Application
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">PWA</a>).

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    If you think there is room for improvement in your current approach to
    password handling, you may find HPASS helpful. One way to store and share
    passwords is by using a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a
    >. It is an often recommended and widely used solution, but not without
    problems.
    <p>
      HPASS(&trade;, &copy;) uses an alternative approach with one major advantage:
      passwords are generated locally, on-demand, and never stored anywhere.
      For convenience, three <em>generic settings</em>  (
      <strong>Secret</strong>,
      <strong>Special Character</strong>,
      <strong>Length</strong>),
      to generate strong, reproducible passwords for any given
      site (defined by <strong>Hint</strong>),
      are stored (encrypted!) only on your local device. 
      For extra layer of security two additional
      parameters are provided, which are never stored anywhere:
      <strong>Top Secret</strong> and
      <strong>Burn</strong>.
      See <a href="help.html">Help section</a>
      for detailed description of all parameters and how
      they are used to generate passwords.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
      Large number of sites and apps offer strong random password generation,
      but quite extensive search (see links below) failed to find any which
      would allow to generate reproducible, hint-derived passwords as HPASS
      does.
    </p>
    <p>
      UPDATE [2024-03-01]: Apparently
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Password_(algorithm)"
        >Master Password</a
      >
      (rebranded now as Spectre
      <a href="https://spectre.app">https://spectre.app</a>) was developed in
      2012. It uses basically the same idea as HPASS -
      <strong>do not store password,
      generate reproducible password when you need it</strong>.
      You can find there extensive explanations why this is a better solution
      then storing passwords, as password managers do. However, the whole
      process Spectre uses seems overcomplicated and restrictive at the same
      time. For example, in addition to the HPASS
      <strong>Secret</strong> eqivalent, it requires user name, it
      generates passwords only following few fixed templates, etc. Take a look,
      and decide for yourself.
    </p>
  -->
    <h2>Typical usage</h2>
    <p>
      Assume you need a password for a website:
      URL=<tt>https://www.abc.com</tt>. You can simply enter <tt>abc</tt> as a
      password hint into <tt>"Enter Hint"</tt> input box and press generate
      button (<img
        src="icons/generate.svg"
        style="width: 2rem; height: 0.8rem"
      />). This will generate password and copy it to the clipboard -
      you can paste it where it is needed.
      <p>
        Note: You can use Second-level Domain
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain">SLD</a>)
        - "abc" in the example above - as a password hint,
        or any other string you can easily associate with a particular site.
        For example, "fb" for "facebook", "bofa" for "bankofamerica", etc.
      </p>
      <!--
      As a convenience feature, if you
      enter the whole URL the app will automatically extract
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain">second-level domain (SLD)</a>
      (i.e. "abc" in this example) as a password <tt><strong>Hint</strong></tt>.
      -->
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The default values for <strong>Special Character</strong>
        (default: "_") and <strong>Length</strong> (default: 15)
        have been selected to be accepted by most sites, however,
        some sites do not accept all special characters,
        and some impose rather short maximum password lengths.
        For these sites you need to change these values and save them
        as <em>site-specific settings</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The purpose of <strong>Secret</strong> is to create unique
        passwords for each user.
      </li>

      <li>
        HPASS generates password from given input parameters through a
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/one_way_hash_algorithm"
          >one-way hash function</a
        >
        The input parameters used to generate password cannot be recovered
        from the password string.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security considerations</h2>
    Keeping only local copy of any sensitive information is more secure and
    less tempting for any potential hackers then keeping it in a centralized location -
    just compare relative effort and payoff of breaking once into
    central database with millions of password vs breaking into millions of
    individual devices.
    However,
    <a
      href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/you-cant-secure-100-of-your-data-100-of-the-time"
      >no information is 100% secure if it is written down</a
    >, and
    <a
      href="https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/letters/theres-no-such-thing-as-100-secure-data/"
    >
      the only secure data is the one that is kept in your head</a
    >
    (barring any
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-016-9398-9">mind-reading capabilities</a>).
    Given that, if you are
    concerned about bad actors breaking into your device
    and stealing settings you use to generate passwords, there are some steps you
    can take to make your passwords virtually 100% secure by paying (small)
    inconvenience price.
    <br><br>
    For example you can:
    <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use <strong>Top Secret</strong> and/or <strong>Burn</strong> for extra layer
        of security. These two parameters are never stored.
      </li>
      <li>Instead of using secondary domain use some nickname
        e.g. "cr" instead "consumerreports" for https://www.consumerreports.org
      </li>
      <li>
        obfuscate secondary domain in some known only to you fashion e.g.
        append some character(s), insert space before the last character, etc.
      </li>
      <li>use generated password as a hint and generate password again</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    You can probably invent infinite number of similar simple schemes to accomplish the same goal i.e.
    that the part of the whole password generating procedure is stored only in
    your head :)
    <!-- Of course, if the sites you need to login into where the
    security is most important (bank accounts, etc.) offer multifactor
    authentication (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"
      >MFA</a
    >) it is always a good idea to use it.
    Note however that with recent rise in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swap scams</a>
    this is not entirely fullproof. -->

    For sites which offer it, multifactor authentication (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"
      >MFA</a
    >) offers extra layer of security. However, rise of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swap scams</a>
    in the 2021-2022 period, illustrates that MFA is not entirely fullproof.

    <h2>Problems with password managers</h2>
    <p>
      You can find multiple sources discussing pros and cons of using password
      manager. Very short list is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> ability to share passwords,
        some offer encrypted storage for other sensitive information
        (credit card numbers, bank accounts, etc.)</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cons:</strong> vulnerability
        to hacking, safety, lock-in for browser build-in password managers.
      </li>
    </ul>
