    <h1>What is HPASS?</h1>
    HPASS(&trade;) is a lightweight, intuitive, simple and easy to use tool to
    create strong passwords.

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    If you think there is a way for improvement in your current approach to
    password handling you may find HPASS helpful. One way to store and share
    passwords is by using a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a
    >. It is an often recommended and widely used solution, but not without
    problems.
    <p>
      HPASS(&trade;) uses an alternative approach with one major advantage:
      passwords are generated locally, on demand and never stored in any central
      location. Passwords and few simple settings to generate them (Secret,
      Special character and Length) are never stored in any centralized
      location, only on your local device, so there is no danger of data breach
      so often reported for password managers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large number of sites and apps offer strong random password generation,
      but quite extensive search (see links below) failed to find any which
      would allow to generate reproducible, hint-derived passwords as HPASS
      does.
    </p>
    <h2>Typical usage</h2>
    <p>
      Assume you have HPASS installed and need a password for
      <tt>https://www.abc.com</tt> website. You simply enter <tt>abc</tt> as a
      password hint into <tt>enter hint</tt> input box and press generate button
      (<img width="32rem" height="16rem" src="icons/generate.svg" />) This will
      generate password string (<tt>57MDf_e1QkNIrD8</tt> assuming
      <tt><strong>Secret</strong></tt> = "SECRET", and default values for
      <tt><strong>Special character</strong></tt> and
      <tt><strong>Length</strong></tt
      >) and copy it to the clipboard. After that you can paste it where it is
      needed. As a convenience feature, if you enter the whole URL (e.g.
      <tt>https://www.abc.com</tt>) the app will atomatically extract
      <tt>abc</tt> (secondary domain) as a password hint.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the default settings (<tt
        ><strong>Special character</strong></tt
      >
      = "_", <tt><strong>Length</strong></tt> = 15) have been selected to
      satisfy most (if not all) websites password requirements - some websites
      will not accept e.g. ? as symbol, and some impose rather short maximum
      password length - 15 seems to be accepted by most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that the way HPASS generates password from given input
      parameters (hint, Secret, Special character, Length) is one-way hash
      function and the input parameters cannot be recovered from the password
      string.
    </p>

    <h2>Security considerations</h2>
    There is always a balance between security and convenience. In HPASS context
    it means that although keeping only local copies of any sensitive
    information is more secure and less tempting for any hackers then keeping it
    in a centralized location - just compare relative effort and potential
    payoff of braking once into central database with millions of password vs
    braking into millions of individual devices -
    <a
      href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/you-cant-secure-100-of-your-data-100-of-the-time"
      >no information is 100% secure if it is written down</a
    >,
    <a
      href="https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/letters/theres-no-such-thing-as-100-secure-data/"
    >
      the only secure data is the one that is kept in your head</a
    >
    (barring any mind-reading :). If you are concerned about the possibility of
    some bad actors braking into your device and stealing settings you use to
    generate password (Secret, Special Character and Length), there are some
    steps you can take to vastly improve security of your password by paying
    (small) inconvenience price. For example you can:
    <ol>
      <li>
        "decorate" hint with some extra characters e.g. instead of using
        <tt>abc</tt> you can always append (or prepend) some character to it
      </li>
      <li>use generated password as a hint and generate password again</li>
    </ol>
    ...and probably you can invent many more simple schemes to accomplish the
    same goal i.e. that the generated password cannot be derived from any stored
    data, since the part of the whole password generating procedure is stored
    only in your mind :) Of course, if the sites you need to login into where
    the security is most important (bank accounts, etc) offer multifactor
    authentication (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"
      >MFA</a
    >) it is always a good idea to use it.

    <h2>Problems with password managers</h2>
    <p>
      You can find multiple sources discussing pros and cons of using password
      manager. Very short list is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> convenience, ability to share passwords</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cons:</strong> need to remember master password, vulnerability
        to hacking, safety
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can argue that HPASS has all adantages and none of dissadventages of
      password managers.
